#SSH toolbox using Silex & phpseclib

To me, the main reason of this code is learning Silex and at the same time obtain something useful.

This tool can be configured to search for bash scripts on a remote server and give a simple web interface to run these scripts.

You can add you own modules to this tool or modify the coonection to use SSH Public Keys.
